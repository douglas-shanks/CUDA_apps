Have finished adding the diffusion coefficient into both
of the MATLAB programs (including the one with the same indexing as thte C++
version. Will add in this to the C++ version (done).
Still have to write a version of CG (don't bother? I'm just learning to use CUDA). Then after this do it all for 3D.
